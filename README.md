# StoryTime

Do you have an interest in collaborative storytelling? Do you want to spark your creativity for writing?
## About The Project
Give Storytime a try! Storytime is a collaborative storytelling app that empowers you to set your imagination free while sharing
inspiration with others. Our app prompts you with words to spark your creativity when you are starting a new story, and then allows
others to pick up the story from wherever you left off. The app is designed to allow users to create, share, and enjoy stories with ease.
Whether you are a seasoned writer or just looking to share your thoughts and ideas, this app can make your storytelling experience
enjoyable and engaging.

Storytime offers four primary user-facing features:

**Creating a New Story**
To encourage creative writing, Storytime prompts users with 5 randomly selected words to use in their new story. Each newly written story is
posted to the feed on the homepage where the community votes on which stories they found to be the most interesting. Every hour, on the hour,
the story with the most upvotes is displayed at the top of the page and becomes the current "canon".

**Collaborating On an Existing Story**
Any user can add to the current "canon" story, their addition will also appear in the feed to be voted on and potentially become "canon". This
is the heart of Storytime: allowing users to collaborate with one another, and collectively decide where the story is going next.

**Badges and Awards** - When a story ends, different badges will be sent out to users that accomplished the best in certain categories Like ‘Most Overall Likes’, ‘Most Contributions’, ‘Most Matched Words’. Their Badges will appear in their user profile. Depending how many badges they have collected will determine the style of their badge.

**Upvote** - A system for users to increment and decrement the like count of responses to other users responses to Story. The response with the most likes are added to the main story and the others are added to the users profile page.
